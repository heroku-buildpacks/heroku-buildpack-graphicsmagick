heroku-buildpack-graphicsmagick
===========================

Use the latest version of GraphicsMagick (1.3.18) inside Heroku.

## Usage

This buildpack is built to be used through
[heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi),
so in your app you need to:
```
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi
```

Then, create a `.buildpacks` file inside your app:
```
https://github.com/mcollina/heroku-buildpack-graphicsmagick
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs
```

This example was based on the nodejs buildpack, but it can be used with
any other.
If it is not working with yours, please report a bug.

## Hacking

To change this buildpack, fork it on Github.  Push up changes to your fork,
then create a test app with `--buildpack <your-github-url>` and push to it.

To change the vendored binaries for ImageMagick, use the helper scripts
in the `support/` subdirectory.
You'll need an S3-enabled AWS account and a bucket to store your
binaries in.
The bucket name and imagemagick version are stored in the configs.sh file,
so update it there (if you plan to contribute back to this repo, do this
in a separate commit).

To rebuild the ImageMagick package, you can:

    $ export AWS_ID=xxx AWS_SECRET=yyy
    $ s3 create $S3_BUCKET
    $ support/package_graphicsmagick

Commit and push the changes to your buildpack to your Github fork, then
push your sample app to Heroku to test.  You should see:
