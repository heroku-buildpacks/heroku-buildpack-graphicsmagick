heroku-buildpack-graphicsmagick
===========================

Use the latest version of GraphicsMagick (1.3.21) inside Heroku.

## Usage

This buildpack is built to be used through
[heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi),
so in your app you need to:
```
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi
```

Then, create a `.buildpacks` file inside your app:
```
https://github.com/mcollina/heroku-buildpack-graphicsmagick
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs
```

This example was based on the nodejs buildpack, but it can be used with
any other.
If it is not working with yours, please report a bug.

## Cedar vs Cedar-14

**You shouldn't need to worry about when using on Heroku.**

There are separate binaries for Heroku's `cedar` and `cedar-14` stacks. When
deploying to Heroku the buildpack automatically chooses which binary to use
based on the `STACK` environment variable that Heroku sets during slug
compilation.

If you are using this buildpack outside of Heroku you will need to make sure to
set the `STACK` environment variable to get the binaries built for your system.

## Hacking

To change this buildpack, fork it on Github.  Push up changes to your fork,
then create a test app with `--buildpack <your-github-url>` and push to it.

To change the vendored binaries for ImageMagick, use the helper scripts
in the `support/` subdirectory.
You'll need an S3-enabled AWS account and a bucket to store your
binaries in.
The bucket name and imagemagick version are stored in the configs.sh file,
so update it there (if you plan to contribute back to this repo, do this
in a separate commit).

Multiple binaries must be built to support Heroku's multiple stacks. If you are
building on `cedar-14` then set `STACK=cedar-14` and if you are building for
`cedar` then set `STACK=cedar` so that the binaries are uploaded to S3
properly.

To rebuild the ImageMagick package, you can:

    $ export AWS_ID=xxx AWS_SECRET=yyy STACK=<cedar or cedar-14>
    $ s3 create $S3_BUCKET
    $ support/package_graphicsmagick

Commit and push the changes to your buildpack to your Github fork, then
push your sample app to Heroku to test.  You should see:

There is also a `Vagrantfile` which can be used with
(Vagrant)[https://www.vagrantup.com/] to build `cedar` and `cedar-14` virtual
machines using Heroku's own open-source provisioning scripts. This allows you
to build and test your changes in a local VM with a shared filesystem rather
than having to push your changes up to Github and building on Heroku.

To build with VMs install (Vagrant)[https://www.vagrantup.com/] and then run
`vagrant up`. Once it completes you will have two running VMs named `cedar` and
`cedar-14`. Vagrant by default will map your project folder to `/vagrant` on
the VM's filesystem.
